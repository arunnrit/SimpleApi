Now the next point is we have to create the pipleine in azure Devops.
Finally we get to azure Devops.
Now Azure devops does not provide hosting environment for creating a pipeline to achieve CI 
Whta is CI?
It is just a process to create a pipeline (It is just a build process + unit test + environment of the application )
We can do same process with jenkins.
We have to create own hosting environment for creating pipeline. Azure devops does not hosting pipleline.
Pool....Agent(Hosting environment)Kestral is a hosting environment....Pipeline....Complete application environment for CI.
